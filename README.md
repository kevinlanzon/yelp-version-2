Yelp Clone
==========
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) Week 9 Project.

This project is a clone of [Yelp](http://www.yelp.co.uk/). The goal is to introduce you to Rails, focusing especially on:

- Creating Rails applications
- The structure of Rails apps (MVC, the router, helpers)
- TDD in Rails, with RSpec & Capybara
- Associations
- Validations
- AJAX in Rails

This is version 2 of the project. I pair programmed with [Meads](https://github.com/meads58). 

We restarted this project on the second day from scratch but this time without using the tutorial. The objectives of this exercise was to fully absorb what we had learned from our first attempt whilst keeping the same objectives - OOD, learning folder structure, setting up a postgresql database and of course TDD.
